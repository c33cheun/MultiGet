# Multi-Get
JavaScript command line application for downloading file in multiple requests

### Getting Started

To setup all node dependencies run:
`node install`

To build run (requires node package manager):
`npm install -g`

Now you can run the script by running:
`multi-get [OPTIONS] <url>`

On Windows there may be some problems with running the above command, due to Windows paths, run the following instead:
`node multi-get.js [OPTIONS] <url>`
from a directory with the multi-get.js file
